Problem statement:
    E-commerce store review classification using DL techniques with cloud deployment:
        python
        Data Analytics
        ML
        DL
        Cloud deployment
    
Database:
    REST.API - to communicate with server
    sqlite
    scrappig the web
    Github
    Dash - develop web apps for analytics
    
3 phases:
    DL project - model
    web scrapping + database
    UI creation

AI - any machine which behaves like a human for some tasks not all.
AI - ML & DL(specific version of ML)
In ML, neural networks as a computer structure as a way to process the data, then it becomes DL.
Types --> Supervisedf and Unsupervised DL
1) Supervised DL:
    a) ANN(Artificial neural network) - regression & classification
    b) CNN(Convoluted neural network) - computer version - open csv
    c) RNN(Recurrent neural network) - like time series analysis:
        Eg. (i) using 10-15 yrs old weather data for weather forecasting.
            (ii) using 10-15 yrs data of any company to predict its stock raise/fall.
            
pandas - for data analytics
Numpy - mathematical operation on data
matplotlib - visualization of data/graphs
keras - DL library from google
sklearn - ML library
Dash - library to create UI - opensource created by plotly

Solution framework:
    E-commerce store review - (+)ve or (-)ve :
        DL model                                                     -|
        python script - to read the reviews                           |
        beautiful soup/selenium/sqlite - for web + store database     |----> Integrate
            #sqlite - used to store contacts in our phone.            |
        UI creation                                                  -|
            
Pickling - store database in pickle file & this file will be used by UI app.

Project development:
    1) Top-Down approach : first learn then do, good approach in reality start with this.
    2) Bottom-Up approach : work on problem statement, start preparing what's needed (Industry goes by this approach)

Python - 2019, stackover flow
1) Data science : Analytics, ML, DL, AI, NLP, Data engineering, anything done around data.
2) Automation : used by testing team --> to test project work, to test the build, to test the apps, to deploy a robot.
    selenium comes under this domain.
3) Web development : 
    a) front end: whatever client sees
       (HTML, CSS, javascript/JS), angularJS - google, reactJS - facebook
    b) Back end: server side
       Php, c#, .NET, java
       NodeJS --> Rust
       Python --> flask (lightweight and simple), Django (Heavyweight and complex)
    c) full stack: front end + back end
